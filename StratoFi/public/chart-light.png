This is a binary file, so I'll describe what needs to be done:

1. Create a PNG image named "chart-light.png" in the public directory
2. This should be a financial chart visualization that looks good in light mode
3. Use colors that contrast well with light backgrounds (darker blues, greens, etc.)
4. The image should have similar dimensions to the existing dark mode chart
